# Project Auto Rates Exchange

 A python srcript that can read the keyboard input for a currency and automatic change to currency ask by user.
 Return the currency as a text in the area where you typing.
 
 For example 
 
 $100 USD to CAD !er ~ That is type by the user in a text box or where ever the user is typing
 
 After some proessing-
 
 $100 USD to 137.33 CAD ~ The exchange rate calculation is added to the text for the user
 
 If there an error, it would be shown like-
 
 $100 USD to CAD !error Can't get connection to Internet.
 
 There is some things you should be aware of, at times error would not be shown and 'ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Code for that currency' has to be follow get the    right currency exchange rate.
 The code is using a API from 'ExchangeRate-API' to the data, and you have to make account to an API key in order for the code to work.
 There is a free tier but with a limit on the data you can get.
